# Log-Structured Merge-Tree


This repository is my attempt at building a Log-Structured Merge-Tree in Clojure. This storage engine indexing strategy is described in the aptly named paper [The Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree)]([https://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/lsmtree.pdf](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/lsmtree.pdf).
